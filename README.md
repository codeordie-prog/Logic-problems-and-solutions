# Logic Problems and Solutions

This repository demonstrates algorithmic thinking and problem-solving approaches for various logical problems in a computational setting. Each solution includes detailed explanations, complexity analysis, and multiple implementation approaches where applicable.

## Problem Categories

The repository contains solutions for various types of problems:

- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Theory
- String Manipulation
- Array/Matrix Operations
- Tree Structures
- Sorting and Searching
- And more...

Each problem category has its own directory containing:
- Problem statement and specifications
- Multiple solution approaches
- Complexity analysis
- Test cases

## Current Problems

### Dynamic Programming
- **Unique Paths**: Calculate the number of unique paths a robot can take from the top-left to bottom-right corner of an m x n grid, moving only right or down.

**Features:**
- Multiple solution approaches (Recursion with Memoization, Tabulation)
- Detailed complexity analysis
- Type hints and PEP 8 compliance
- Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeordie-prog/Logic-problems-and-solutions.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Logic-problems-and-solutions
```

3. Run any solution:
```bash
python <problem_category>/<problem_name>/solutions.py
```

## Problem-Solving Approach

Each problem in this repository follows a structured approach:

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Understanding the problem statement
   - Identifying constraints and requirements
   - Breaking down the problem into smaller components

2. **Solution Design**
   - Multiple solution approaches
   - Complexity analysis
   - Space-time trade-offs

3. **Implementation**
   - Clean, well-documented code
   - Type hints for better code understanding
   - PEP 8 compliance
   - Comprehensive test cases

4. **Documentation**
   - Detailed explanations
   - Complexity analysis
   - Usage examples
